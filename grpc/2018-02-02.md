Just finished refreshing my memory on protocol buffers. Now on to GRPC.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/index.html#overview  
Explains RPC. I know this. Moving on.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/index.html#working-with-protocol-buffers  
Skipping this section, I just read about protocol buffers.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html  
Four types of services:
`unary` single message from client, single response from server
`server streaming` single message from client, streaming response from server
`client streaming` client streams to server, server sends single response
`bidirectional streaming` just what it sounds like.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#using-the-api-surface  
Server runs a GRPC server to handle client calls. GRPC decodes requests and
executes methods, encodes responses and sends them.
Client executes similar methods and doesn't know how they are executed.
Yup, RPC.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#synchronous-vs-asynchronous  
Ideally things are sync because it is easy to reason about, but, get real,
the network is not reliable kid.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#rpc-life-cycle  
https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#unary-rpc
- Client notifies server it is calling a method (with a deadline, if applicable)
- Server can send back metadata before responding immediately or wait for the
  client's request message.
- Once server has message it does whatever work is needed to satisfy the request.
- Response is sent, if successful.
- If status is OK, client gets the response and the cycle is over.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#server-streaming-rpc  
Same as above but multiple messages are sent back.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#client-streaming-rpc
Same as above but client streams request in.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#bidirectional-streaming-rpc
More or less the same as above except the client and server can read/write in
any order, the channels are independent.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#deadlinestimeouts  
GRPC has a facility to say how long it will wait for a message. Some languages
use a fixed point deadline, others use a duration from message reciept.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#rpc-termination  
Both the client and server make independent and local determinations of the
success of the call. Conclusions may not match. For example, an RPC could
finishes successfully on the server side (“I have sent all my responses!”) but
fails on the client side (“The responses arrived after my deadline!”). It’s
also possible for a server to decide to complete before a client has sent all
its requests.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#cancelling-rpcs  
Client and server can cancel request at any time. This is not an undo.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#metadata  
Metadata is sent as key/value pairs and is transparent to GRPC.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#channels  
Channels have state, such as connected/idle.

# 19:20
https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth.html  
Works with a variety of auth mechanisms.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth.html#supported-auth-mechanisms  
`SSL/TLS` Just use it.
`Token-based` Used in addition to SSL/TLS, typically.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth.html#authentication-api  
gRPC provides a simple authentication API based around the unified concept of
Credentials objects, which can be used when creating an entire gRPC channel or
an individual call.

`Channel credentials` attached to a Channel, such as SSL credentials.
`Call credentials` are attached to a call.

...skipping the rest of this section. I will return to this later. I need to get
a service stood up first.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/error.html  
A list of status codes. Makes sense.

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/benchmarking.html  
Looking forward to doing this. Not now though.

Note to self, read about the wire format later:

https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go.html  
Let's see how this is done in Go.

https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go.html#defining-the-service  
Describes a simple proto file with RPC and message definitions. All makes sense.

https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go.html#generating-client-and-server-code  
Simple call to `protoc`, I've done this before. Makes sense.

https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go.html#creating-the-server  
Just noticed a comment //go:generate in one of the example files. Taking a
detour.

https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2016-11-27-how-to-use-go-generate/  
Neat. Don't know that I'll use this but it is cool to know what it is. I should
probably go find official documentation rather than relying on a blog post but
this is enough to satisfy my curiosity for now.

https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go.html#client-side-streaming-rpc  
https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go.html#bidirectional-streaming-rpc  
I understand everything in here conceptually. I need to anchor these ideas in
an actual implementation, though. Will be doing that with the imagepipe service.

https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go.html#starting-the-server  
Makes sense.
