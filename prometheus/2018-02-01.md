In the car with Tara. Time to learn how to monitor my Kubernetes cluster.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/  
Built at SoundCloud. Neat!

No reliance on distributed storage.
Pull model for metrics.

Supports an alertmanager. I'll need to look that up too.

Written in go. Like everything ops related these days.

Can discover targets via Kubernetes.
Grafana is typically used to visualize.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/  
Going to run prometheus!

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#downloading-prometheus  
Got it.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#configuring-prometheus  
Uses YAML configuration. Sweet.

Seems to be an error in the docs about the number of global config options.
PR submitted:
https://github.com/prometheus/docs/pull/960

`global` block affects all targets, but can be overridden.

`rules` block specifies rules... none to start.

`scrape_configs` block specifies what will be monitored. Prometheus can monitor
itself. That's what the default config shows. By default Prometheus expects to
find metrics at /metrics endpoint on the specified host:port pairing.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#starting-prometheus  
Makes sense to me.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#using-the-expression-browser  
Some simple examples using expressions. There is a whole expression language to
learn. Not diving in yet.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#using-the-graphing-interface  
You can see the data in graph form too... though I think you wind up doing this
with grafana instead? I guess we'll see.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#installing-the-node-exporter  
Time to install an exporter that can expose lots of data about my machine.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#configuring-prometheus-to-monitor-the-host  
...and wire up prometheus to monitor it.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#summary
Makes sense so far!

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/  
Let's see where this falls in the ecosystem at large...

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#prometheus-vs.-graphite  
Graphite is a passive time series database with graphing and querying. It does
not know what the system should look like, it just knows what the system does
look like.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#data-model  
When combined with statds, graphite typically only stores aggregate data.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#storage  
Graphite has RRD style database. Each time series has a file.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#summary  
Promethus has a richer data model / query language and is operationally simple.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#prometheus-vs-influxdb  
InfluxDB came a year after Prometheus. Geared toward a slightly different use
case (what one? ...maybe it will be clear shortly).

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#scope-0  
In conjunction with the project Kapacitor, InfluxDB serves similar goals to
Prometheus and Alertmanager. The same scope differences as in the case of
Graphite apply here for InfluxDB itself. In addition InfluxDB offers continuous
queries, which are equivalent to Prometheus recording rules.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#data-model-storage  
https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#architecture  
https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#summary  
Skimming a bit here. These details are not super important to me right now.
