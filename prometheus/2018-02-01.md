In the car with Tara. Time to learn how to monitor my Kubernetes cluster.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/  
Built at SoundCloud. Neat!

No reliance on distributed storage.
Pull model for metrics.

Supports an alertmanager. I'll need to look that up too.

Written in go. Like everything ops related these days.

Can discover targets via Kubernetes.
Grafana is typically used to visualize.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/  
Going to run prometheus!

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#downloading-prometheus  
Got it.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#configuring-prometheus  
Uses YAML configuration. Sweet.

Seems to be an error in the docs about the number of global config options.
PR submitted:
https://github.com/prometheus/docs/pull/960

`global` block affects all targets, but can be overridden.

`rules` block specifies rules... none to start.

`scrape_configs` block specifies what will be monitored. Prometheus can monitor
itself. That's what the default config shows. By default Prometheus expects to
find metrics at /metrics endpoint on the specified host:port pairing.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#starting-prometheus  
Makes sense to me.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#using-the-expression-browser  
Some simple examples using expressions. There is a whole expression language to
learn. Not diving in yet.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#using-the-graphing-interface  
You can see the data in graph form too... though I think you wind up doing this
with grafana instead? I guess we'll see.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#installing-the-node-exporter  
Time to install an exporter that can expose lots of data about my machine.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#configuring-prometheus-to-monitor-the-host  
...and wire up prometheus to monitor it.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#summary
Makes sense so far!

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/  
Let's see where this falls in the ecosystem at large...

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#prometheus-vs.-graphite  
Graphite is a passive time series database with graphing and querying. It does
not know what the system should look like, it just knows what the system does
look like.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#data-model  
When combined with statds, graphite typically only stores aggregate data.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#storage  
Graphite has RRD style database. Each time series has a file.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#summary  
Promethus has a richer data model / query language and is operationally simple.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#prometheus-vs-influxdb  
InfluxDB came a year after Prometheus. Geared toward a slightly different use
case (what one? ...maybe it will be clear shortly).

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#scope-0  
In conjunction with the project Kapacitor, InfluxDB serves similar goals to
Prometheus and Alertmanager. The same scope differences as in the case of
Graphite apply here for InfluxDB itself. In addition InfluxDB offers continuous
queries, which are equivalent to Prometheus recording rules.

https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#data-model-storage  
https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#architecture  
https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#summary  
Skimming a bit here. These details are not super important to me right now.

Talking to Mike.

https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/  
It's a time series database.

https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels  
Each time series has a unique metric name and a set of labels (kv pairs).

Metric name specifies the feature being measured.

Labels give dimensional data. HTTP method, URL, etc.

https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#samples  
The actual data recorded. float64 or millisecond precision timestamp.

https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#notation  
A way of expressing a reference to a time series using a metric and labels

https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/  
Client library provides four metric types. These types are not used by
Prometheus (yet), they are flattened to an untyped format.

https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter  
A cumulative metric that only goes up.

https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge  
A single numerical value that can go up or down.

https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram  
Count observations in configurable buckets. Request sizes might be sliced into
groups based on size, for example.

https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#summary  
Similar to a histogram, samples observations and calculates configurable
quantiles over a sliding time window.

https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/  
An endpoint you can scrape is called an instance. Usually the endpoint belongs
to a single process. A collection of instances is a job.

https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/#automatically-generated-labels-and-time-series  
When scraping a target, some labels are attached automatically. The job (the
name configured for the target) and the instance (host:port of metric endpoint).

# 20:30
https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/  
Yup, there are a bunch of ways to install this thing.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/  
Command line flags configure immutable system params (memory usage, storage
locations, etc). Config file defines everything related to what will be scraped
and what rules will be used for alerting.

SIGHUP or POST to /-/reload will reload config. If new config is invalid it will
not be used.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#configuration-file  
`--config.file` specifies a path to the config file. Shocker.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config  
Specify a set of targets and the parameters around how to scrape them.
Targets can be configured statically with `static_config` or dynamically using
a supported service discovery method (I'll use `kubernetes_sd_configs`).

`relabel_configs` lets you modify labels.

`node` role finds one target per node in the cluster.

`service` role finds one target per service in the cluster.

`pod` role finds one target per open port per container in each pod in the cluster.

`endpoints` role finds one target for each endpoint address

`ingress` role finds one target for each path of each ingress.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/#defining-recording-rules  
Two types of rules, recording and alerting. `rule_files` config value enumerates
the location of separate rule files.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/#syntax-checking-rules  
Handy tool for checking rule syntax.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/#recording-rules  
Recording rules allow you to precompute frequently needed or complex expressions
and save the result to a new time-series file. Used often for dashboards where
the same rules are recomputed continuously.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules  
Define promql expressions and send notifications to an external service.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/#defining-alerting-rules
Definition works basically the same as recording rules.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/#templating
Go templating is supported.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/#inspecting-alerts-during-runtime
A time series of active alerts is produced by prometheus.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/#sending-alert-notifications
Alerting rules are great for seeing what is broken NOW, but another tool is used
to manage how people are notified, Alertmanager.

Get all time series with a defined metric name, e.g.:

`http_requests_total` all time series that have this name
`http_requests_total` is sugar for `{__name__="http_requests_total"}`
`http_requests_total{job="prometheus",group="canary"}` limit by labels
`http_requests_total{environment=~"staging|testing|development",method!="GET"}` more complex label filtering

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#range-vector-selectors  
Modify instant vector selectors with a time range relative to now.
`http_requests_total{job="prometheus"}[5m]` just what it seems like

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#offset-modifier  
`http_requests_total offset 5m` get value from 5 minutes ago.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#operators  
https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#functions  
More details in next section.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#staleness  
If no samples are found for 5 minutes, they disappear from the graph.
When using aggregate methods across multiple time series, Prometheus tries to
account for differences in time by selecting the closest match in the future.
I *think* what I just wrote makes sense. Note to self, tinker with this in the
future or ask Ian to show me the real world impact of this.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#avoiding-slow-queries-and-overloads

browser :p

Data is stored on disk, but can be stored remotely as well.

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#on-disk-layout
