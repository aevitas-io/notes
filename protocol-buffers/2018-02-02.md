To date, when writing services I have nearly always used REST/json interfaces.
I've looked at using GRPC and protocol buffers a few times but it always
rankled to me that I couldn't hit those services (easily) over HTTP. While
learning how to operationalize etcd I came across this:

https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/dev-guide/api_grpc_gateway.html  

I am now implementing my first service on my cluster and I'm super excited about
the prospect of developing protobuf/grpc services that can have RESTful
endpoints that are dynamically generated.

https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem  
Has several projects that will be useful for enabling this.

It's time to read the protocol buffers documentation.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3  
Makes sense.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#simple  
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#specifying-field-types  
Pretty straightforward. I've used this stuff in a small experiments in the past.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#assigning-tags  
Each field has a numbered tag, this is how they are found in the binary
representation.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#specifying-field-rules  
You can specify single values or multiple for each field.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#adding-more-message-types  
You can define multiple messages types in a single proto file.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#adding-comments  
Comments are C style, `/* comment */`

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#reserved  
If you remove a field in some iteration of your proto file, it is advisable
to mark it reserved so the tag number is never used again.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#whats-generated-from-your-proto  
C++
.h and .cc + class for each message type.

Java
.java file with class for each message type + special Builder class for making
instances of messages.

Python
modules with a static descriptor used to with a metaclass to create the needed
interface at runtime.

Go
.pb.go file with a type for each message.

Ruby
.rb file with a ruby module for each message type.

JavaNano
Similar to java, no builder class though.

Objective-C
pbobj.h pbobj.m file from each `.proto` with a class for each message type.

C#
A class for each message type described in your file.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#scalar  
Check.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#default  
If a field is missing (and not required) it is filled with the empty value.
After parsing there is no way to tell if the default value was used because the
field was omitted.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#enum  
You can use enums to define valid possible values.
All enums must include at least one entry that maps to zero, this is the zero
value that will be taken if the field is omitted.
Enums can be defined outside of messages and re-used with `allow_alias`.
You can also reference enums in other message definitions with the fully
specified name.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#other  
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#importing-definitions
Message fields can reference other message types.
To use message types from other proto files you can import them.
In general you should set the --proto_path flag to the root of your project and
use fully qualified names for all imports.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#nested  
It's also possible to nest message types directly in messages.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#updating  
You can update message types any time you like, but take care to do this:
  * Don't change the numeric tags for any existing fields.
  * New field added are fine, old messages sent to the new parsers will be ignored
    and new fields in messages parsed by old parsers will be ignored too.
  * When removing fields, mark the tag number reserved and never use it again.
  * int32, uint32, int64, uint64, bool, are all compatible. Change at will.
  * sint32, sint64 are compatible with eachother, not other int types.
  * string, bytes are compatible as long as they are valid UTF-8
  * Embedded messages are compatible with bytes if they are encoded correctly.
  * fixed32 and sfixed32 are compatible.
  * fixed64 and sfixed64 are compatible.
  * enum is compatible with int32, uint32, int64, and uint64 in the format on the
    wire but might be parsed differently depending on the consumer.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#unknowns  
Don't rely on unknown fields.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any  
This makes it possible to define dynamic field types that reference external
`.proto` files.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#oneof  
Lets you define a field as being one of many possible message types.
Parsers who find multiple entries for a given field will use the last one.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#maps  
Associative maps can be defined.
```
map<key_type, value_type> map_field = N;
```
key_type can be any int/scalar, value_type can be anything but another map.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#backwards-compatibility
The map syntax is sugar for a representation that works with older parsers so
you can use it freely.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#packages
You can namespace your .proto files with `package`.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#packages-and-name-resolution  
The innermost scope is searched, then the next-innermost, and so on, with each
package considered to be "inner" to its parent package. A leading '.' means to
start from the outermost scope instead (e.g. .foo.bar.Baz)

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#services  
If you want to use message types with an RPC system (like GRPC), it's possible
to simply map message types and responses to named method calls.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json  
If a value is missing in JSON-encoded data, or if the value is null, it will be
interpreted as the appropriate default when parsed into a protocol buffer. If a
field has the default value in the protocol buffer it will be omitted.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#options  
Definitions can be annotated with options.
`java_package` the package used for java classes. overrides proto package.
`java_multiple_files` blah blah java
`java_outer_classname` blah blah java
`optimize_for`
  * `SPEED`
    * the default. serializing /parsing / common operations have code gen.
  * `CODE_SIZE`
    * minimal classes, use reflection, useful for apps that have tons of proto
      files and don't need to be crazy fast.
  * `LITE_RUNTIME`
    * useful for constrained platforms like mobile phones.
`cc_enable_arenas` arena allocation for C++
`objc_class_prefix` objc
`deprecated` signals a field should not be used.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#custom_options  
You can extend options but probably won't need to.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#generating  
Check.

# 18:45
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style  
Use CamelCase identifiers for message names.
Use underscore_separated identifiers for field names.
Use CAPITALS_WITH_UNDERSCORES for enum type names.
Use CamelCase for service name and RPC method names.

https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding  
Skipping for now.
