I have a history using and maintaining ci pipelines, artifact repositories,
configuration management tooling, secrets management solutions, http
servers, reverse proxies, load balancers, monitoring systems etc etc etc.

I have participated in creating software ecosystems that receive millions
of downloads monthly. I have a visceral understanding of how hard dependency
management is.

I am a pretty decent autodidact.

If anyone can make this jump, it ought to be me.

I plan to use Kubernetes.

I will start by reading all of the official documentation. I'll stop at
each section header to record my findings.

Down the rabbit hole I go.

Boy, there are a lot of ways to install this thing.

I'll start with minikube, it is supposed to let me run kubernetes locally
with ease.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#installation  
I have VT-x enabled.
I have a hypervisor already (VirtualBox).
I guess I have to install kubectl before I can install minikube.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/  
I choose to install kubectl using cURL.
Got that going in seconds.
I am skipping the setup for shell completions for now.
Now I am returning to the minikube installation section.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#installation  
Installing minikube defers to installing it by following instructions on
the latest release. I'm sent here:

https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases  
Based on the release notes I'm installing minikube using an ad-hoc cURL
command provided.

Heading back to the minikube docs now.
