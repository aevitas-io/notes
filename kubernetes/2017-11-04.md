# 13:40
Digging in again. Where was I?

Ah yes, staying in the the tutorials section.

I wonder how many human hours have been invested in this documentation. I am
sort of bowled over today by the idea that all of this is freely available.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/configure-redis-using-configmap/  
Looks like this page requires reading two other sections. Here we go.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/#before-you-begin  
Trying to remember what commands I need to ensure I have a cluster locally.
Let's see. Am I still running the minikube VM?. A quick ps | grep xhyve
finds it.

There must be a minikube command for this... yup.

❯ minikube status
minikube: Running
cluster: Running
kubectl: Correctly Configured: pointing to minikube-vm at 192.168.64.6

Okay, here goes.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/#use-kubectl-to-create-a-configmap  
Okay, so k8s has a key/value store. I assume that's powered by etcd.

Let's see what's in it now.

I tried running `kubectl get` but it wants me to ask for something specific.
Also, there is a command called `kubectl explain` that seems interesting.

`kubectl explain pods`
Neat, this is like a mini set of built in documentation. Okay, back to
the kv store.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/#create-configmaps-from-directories  
The tutorial section of the site often shows example commands that expect
to interact with files I don't have. I assume they are in the website repo.

Going to go re-clone that.

`git clone git@github.com:kubernetes/website.git`

Yup, the example files are there.

Okay, so this seems to be a way to easily bring config files from a folder
into the cluster. It also looks like there are some commands to generate
different representations of the config files. Sweet.

I wonder what the lifecycle for managing these will be like. Right now when
I make config file changes they wind up in a source tree and all subsequent
deployments use them by virtue of the fact that they've been committed...

...will I still commit everything and then either manually update stuff or
automate changes with CI/CD?

We'll see I guess.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/#create-configmaps-from-files  
Okay yeah, so I can individually add files to a configmap too. Check.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/#create-configmaps-from-literal-values  
...and right from the cli too. I wonder what use cases there will be for
hucking random configs into the cluster.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/#understanding-configmaps  
This should be the first section.

There is a note that says ConfigMaps should *reference* properties files
and not replace them. That seems to point in the direction of retaining them
in source control and not relying on the cluster to provide them, which
lines up with my thinking so far.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/  
Lots of stuff here! *rolls up sleeves*

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#define-pod-environment-variables-using-configmap-data  
So, this section is showing how to control the environment variables for
a pod using ConfigMap values. Makes sense.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#configure-all-key-value-pairs-in-a-configmap-as-pod-environment-variables  
Okay, so the previous example shows how to pluck specific values from
ConfigMaps, this example shows how to use ALL the key/value pairs from
a ConfigMap in a pod with `envFrom`.

I like this much better.

But... if the value side of a ConfigMap isn't a string, what will happen?

Is it possible to assign arrays, for example?

Digging.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1.8/#configmap-v1-core  
...not answered

Values are defined in metadata... checking there? (later edit: not true)

The API docs above link to:
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata  

This is developer-facing API documentation for kubernetes and is quite long.
I'll take this detour.

# 14:00
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata  

> When a new version of an object is POSTed or PUT, the "spec" is updated
and available immediately. Over time the system will work to bring the
"status" into line with the "spec". The system will drive toward the most
recent "spec" regardless of previous versions of that stanza. In other
words, if a value is changed from 2 to 5 in one PUT and then back down to
3 in another PUT the system is not required to 'touch base' at 5 before
changing the "status" to 3. In other words, the system's behavior is
level-based rather than edge-based. This enables robust behavior in the
presence of missed intermediate state changes.

Neat.

As an API specification author myself (jsonapi.org), this doc is
fascinating.

One thing that stood out mid-read is that they have a custom content type
called strategic merge patch to cover cases not handled by
application/json-patch+json or application/merge-patch+json.

Detouring again...

https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/strategic-merge-patch.md  
I am sure this was the best thing to do given the constraints the team who
developed this had but... yuck.

Back to:
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata  
...okay, I gotta get out of these internals.
I don't want to know this stuff yet.

# 14:15
Where was I? Oh yeah. Can ConfigMap values be arrays/hashes/etc? If so,
how does that affect trying to use them as environment variables?
I can't find a clear reference in the docs. Let me just try it directly.

Here is my test.yml file
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
name: test
namespace: default
data:
array:
- foo
- bar
- baz
```

`kubectl -f apply test.yml` fails.
error: error validating "test.txt": error validating data: ValidationError(ConfigMap.data.array): invalid type for io.k8s.api.core.v1.ConfigMap.data: got "array", expected "string"; if you choose to ignore these errors, turn validation off with --validate=false

Strings only unless you opt into the footgun with --validate=false. Okay,
that's enough detour.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#use-configmap-defined-environment-variables-in-pod-commands  
You can use the environment variables in commands too. Nice.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#add-configmap-data-to-a-volume  
Cool, you can also mount ConfigMaps and expose their values in files.

# 14:20
Trying to spin up a pod to test mounting volumes and it's failing to get the
container image:
failed to pull image "gcr.io/google_containers/busybox": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: Get https://gcr.io/v2/: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)

Debugging...

I think this is the first time I've tried to run a Pod that uses a docker
image that isn't in the registry of docker running in the minikube VM.

Let's see... how would I validate outbound communication? Can I ssh into
the minikube VM? Checking...

yup.

```
minikube ssh
```

Can't ping anything on the internet. Before I go down a rabbit hole trying
to figure this out let me recycle this VM.

```
minikube delete
rm -rf ~/.minikube
minikube start --vm-driver xhyve
minikube ssh
```

...and fixed. No idea what that was.

# 14:40
Okay, what was I doing? Oh yeah, trying to see a ConfigMap represented as
a mounted volume in a container.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#populate-a-volume-with-data-stored-in-a-configmap  
Got it going with the example. Damn, this stuff is powerful. The mounted
volumes update automatically (eventually) when the ConfigMap changes. I
am immediately reminded of consul-template. I'm sure there is some k8s
equivalent way of having applications update their config values...

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#understanding-configmaps-and-pods  
Some more detail here on my musing about envFrom. Invalid ConfigMap keys
will be skipped when generating environment variables.

There is a caveat at the end here about how "Kubelet doesn't support the use
of ConfigMaps for pods not found on the API server." No idea what that is.
Not going to look now.

# 15:00
Okay, now I know what ConfigMaps are all about. Neat. Back to trying to use
them.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/configure-redis-using-configmap/#objectives  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/configure-redis-using-configmap/#before-you-begin  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/configure-redis-using-configmap/#real-world-example-configuring-redis-using-a-configmap  
Glad I cloned the website repo, more references to files I don't have.
This should really be a part of the "before you begin" section. Stopping
to open an issue.

https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/6185  

# 15:10
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/configure-redis-using-configmap/#real-world-example-configuring-redis-using-a-configmap  
This all worked out as expected. Cool stuff.

# 15:20
Switching to another reality. Be back soon.
Neighbors are coming up to help me set up a bat box.
https://batmanagement.com/products/bat-bunker-plus-bat-house  

# 17:30
And we're back. What am I doing? I left off on configuring redis with
ConfigMaps and mounted volumes. Let's see...

Okay, again sticking to the tutorial side of the site... time to learn
object management with kubernetes.

Here goes.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/object-management/  
I love that this document exists. I can already tell this is going to answer
a lot of questions I have.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/object-management/#imperative-commands  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/object-management/#imperative-object-configuration  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/object-management/#declarative-object-configuration  
I've been using this a bunch without really understanding it. When I
realized I could do `kubectl apply -f file.yml` and it would just work I
started using that command for everything. I ran into the disadvantages
listed a few times, wondering how it was going to merge the changes.

Digging into each form with a bit more detail now:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-command/#trade-offs  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-command/#how-to-create-objects  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-command/#how-to-update-objects  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-command/#how-to-delete-objects  
Makes sense. So far I prefer using commands specific to objects over
aspects at this stage. I want to be forced to understand the underlying
schema. It would be cool if the aspect-based commands showed the object
commands it was going to run...

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-command/#how-to-view-an-object  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-command/#using-set-commands-to-modify-objects-before-creation  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-command/#using---edit-to-modify-objects-before-creation  
Weird. No idea what I would use these for.

Bathroom break.

# 17:45
Back. Next section.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/#trade-offs  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/#how-to-create-objects  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/#how-to-update-objects  
Interesting gotcha here. Using replace can muck up any computed values.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/#how-to-delete-objects  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/#how-to-view-an-object  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/#limitations  
So, managing objects in this way means the config file I use will trump
everything in the system no matter where it came from, and in some cases
this can blow away values that are needed. (later note: not fully accurate)

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/#creating-and-editing-an-object-from-a-url-without-saving-the-configuration  
This is neat sugar for managing objects from URLs.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/#migrating-from-imperative-commands-to-imperative-object-configuration  
Blech.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/#defining-controller-selectors-and-podtemplate-labels  
Not quite sure what this means. Going to ignore it for now and keep going.

# 18:15
Nevermind. On the phone with friends.

# 18:55
...and we're back.

Next section. Declarative config management. Going to do this and call it
a night.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#before-you-begin  
I am so glad this document exists. I feel sure this is going to speak to
the torrent of questions that have filled my mind every time I thought
about moving to this kind of architecture.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#how-to-create-objects  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#how-to-update-objects  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#how-to-update-objects  
Most important note in here seems to be:

> Warning: Mixing kubectl apply with the imperative object configuration
commands create and replace is not supported. This is because create and
replace do not retain the kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration
that kubectl apply uses to compute updates.

From earlier section of docs:
> Note: Declarative object configuration retains changes made by other
writers, even if the changes are not merged back to the object
configuration file. This is possible by using the patch API operation to
write only observed differences, instead of using the replace API operation
to replace the entire object configuration.

Based on both of those notes, I believe this to be true?
Any field that was created by applying a configuration will be removed
at the next apply if that field is removed in the configuration.
All other fields will be updated or added at the next apply based update.
Fields added by imperative updates will not be removed if they are absent
in an apply because the declarative system is effectively unaware of it.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#how-to-delete-objects  
Makes sense to me. Basic takeaway is delete stuff directly. I won't try to
use the declarative system to prune objects until I have a full mental model
of the kubernetes object schema and the live system I am modifying.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#how-to-view-an-object  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#how-apply-calculates-differences-and-merges-changes  
Looks like this section has a detailed breakdown of what I said my
assumption was earlier. This is a complex operation but they've explained it
quite well.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#how-different-types-of-fields-are-merged  
Ooof, this is getting hairy.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#merging-changes-to-primitive-fields  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#merging-changes-to-map-fields  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#merging-changes-for-fields-of-type-list  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#replace-the-list  
Makes sense. I am going to have to bookmark this page.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#merge-individual-elements-of-a-list-of-complex-elements  
Makes sense. I'll say it again, this is going to take a bit to fully
internalize.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#default-field-values  
...

# 19:40
Whoops, just overshot dinner with the neighbors @ 7:30. Gotta go.

# 22:15
Back.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#default-field-values  
This section explains how k8s sets default values to fill in under-specified
configurations. There are a lot of gotchas. I am ignoring this. I'll just
always specify the full configuration for explicitly. I get that this is
supposed to be helpful but I think this kind of behavior is almost always
a detriment in the long run.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#how-to-clear-server-defaulted-fields-or-fields-set-by-other-writers  
Ignoring this, see previous.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#how-to-change-ownership-of-a-field-between-the-configuration-file-and-direct-imperative-writers  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#changing-the-owner-from-a-direct-imperative-writer-to-a-configuration-file  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#changing-the-owner-from-a-configuration-file-to-a-direct-imperative-writer  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#changing-management-methods
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#migrating-from-imperative-command-management-to-declarative-object-configuration  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#migrating-from-imperative-object-configuration-to-declarative-object-configuration  
These sections explain how to move between different config management
approaches. I am ignoring all of this for now. I will opt into the most
complex/complete form (declarative) from the outset and only work in that
manner.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/declarative-object-management-configuration/#defining-controller-selectors-and-podtemplate-labels  
No idea what this section is talking about. Probably because I didn't read
the previous. Moving on.

# 22:30
Learning about running stateless applications now.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/#objectives  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/#before-you-begin

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/#deleting-a-deployment  
I know how to do all of this already. Skipping.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/#replicationcontrollers----the-old-way  
If I see ReplicationController anywhere, I can know that has been replaced
by the Deployment resource. Also, I need to investigate the Deployment
resource to see what it is comprised of.

This is so so dope.

# 22:35
Learning about running stateful applications now. Here come the volumes.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-single-instance-stateful-application/#objectives  
Ready.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-single-instance-stateful-application/#deploy-mysql  
This describes how an application can get access to a PersistentVolume
via a PersistentVolumeClaim and is a bit confusing since I haven't read
about volumes at all yet. My brain is a haze now, thinking about the
implications how this works in dev vs prod.

Jumping out to go read about volumes directly.

# 22:40
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#background  
Volumes in Kubernetes are not like volumes in Docker. Volumes have a
lifetime--that of the pod they are inside. Containers for a Pod can come
and go but the Volume lives on. There are lots of Volume types and Pods can
use many at the same time. A volume is just a directory, maybe with some
data in it, which is accessible to containers in a pod. Volumes can not
mount within other Volumes.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#types-of-volumes  
Holy hell that is a lot of volume types. I love that this huge list ends
with "We welcome additional contributions."

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir  
These are created when the first Pod is assigned to a Node. When the Pod is
removed, the directory is destroyed. Used for scratch space, checkpointing
long computations, etc. By default, these are stored on the disk the node is
using but you can also have them be ramdisks if you don't care about the
data being lost if the host Node reboots.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath  
Give a pod access to the host filesystem. Seems an esoteric option that I
won't need. Skimmed but ignoring mostly for now--just knowing I can do this
is enough.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#gcepersistentdisk  
GCE disks. Makes sense. Not destroyed on pod destruction, just unmounted.
Can be shared across multiple consumers in read only mode.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#awselasticblockstore  
Same as GCE, just AWS. Some obvious (to me) restrictions like you can't
mount an EBS volume from a different region/az than a Pod is running on.

# 23:20
Tara's home. Taking a break.

# 23:45
...and Tara's going to bed.

Where was I?
Volumes.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#nfs  
Just what it says on the tin, as @mattsurabian would say.
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#iscsi  
Supports multiple read only consumers.
Only one read/write.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#flocker  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#glusterfs  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#rbd  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#cephfs  
Yeah yeah.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#gitrepo  
Neeeeeat.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#secret  
I can't wait to use this.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#persistentvolumeclaim  
An abstraction over multiple storage types. Cool!

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#downwardapi  
Wooooosh. This is an incredible idea but I don't have a use case for it yet.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#projected  
Dope.

This is ridiculously powerful stuff.
