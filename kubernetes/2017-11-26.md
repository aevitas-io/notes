I have a k8s cluster running and my k8s-in-a-single-bash-file-script mostly
complete. I have now looked closely enough at this project to see that it is
complete chaos, like any other endeavor of this size. Complexity is such a
hard beast to tame.

I am stuck on what appears to be the last hurdle: trying to figure out how
to get the kubelets to authorize with the apiserver using the
"Node Authorizer".

Good documentation around this relatively new functionality seems scarce.
There is one section of the k8s website I haven't read, the "Reference"
section. Giving that a shot now to see if I can find what I am missing.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/#determine-whether-a-request-is-allowed-or-denied  
API server authorizes requests and all attributes of requests against a
system of policies. All parts of the request must be allowed to proceed.
AKA: deny all is the first rule.

If multiple authorization modes are enabled, each must be passed through.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/#review-your-request-attributes  
These portions of a request are used for authorization:

user
the username specified.
group
a list of group names the user belongs to
extra
arbitrary key value pairs provided by the auth layer
API
if the request is for an API resource (???)
request path
path to non api resources e.g. /healthz
api request verb
get, list, create, update, patch, watch, proxy, etc... this is derived
http post = create  
http get,head = get or list (individual vs collection)  
http put = patch  
http delete = delete or deletecollection (individual vs collection)  
http request verb  
get, post, put, patch, delete etc
resource
id or name of resource
subresource
just what you'd think
namespace
just what you'd think
api group

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/#determine-the-request-verb  
K8s sometimes checks authorization for additional perms using specialized verbs.
...aka good luck, there are no conventions!

PodSecurityPolicy
checks for authorization of the "use" verb on podsecuritypolicies

RBAC
checks for authorization of the "bind" verb on roles and clusterroles

Authentication
checks for authorization of the impersonate verb on users, groups, and serviceaccounts in the core API group, and the userextras in the authentication.k8s.io API group.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/#authorization-modules  
Node
Grants perms to kubelets based on the pods they are scheduled to run.

ABAC
Attribute-based access control (ABAC) defines an access control paradigm
whereby access rights are granted to users through the use of policies
which combine attributes together.

RBAC
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to
computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users
within an enterprise. In this context, access is the ability of an
individual user to perform a specific task, such as view, create, or
modify a file.

Seems like RBAC and ABAC are general concepts I am not familiar with. Going
to read about in the context of k8s now... googling

http://blog.kubernetes.io/2017/04/rbac-support-in-kubernetes.html  
Seems like ABAC is an early attempt that k8s is trying to phase out. This
control system requires cluster restarts and ssh access to make changes.

Webhook
Event-notification via HTTP POST. A callback.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/#checking-api-access  
Neat. kubectl has a 'auth can-i' command that lets you see what you or
anyone else can do.
```
kubectl auth can-i create deployments
```

...or

```
kubectl auth can-i create deployments as dave
```

Access to this feature is controlled by settings to
SelfSubjectAccessReview, LocalSubjectAccessReview, SelfSubjectRulesReview.

I don't fully understand what the above means, but I'm good to continue for
now.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/#using-flags-for-your-authorization-module  
When running the apiserver set which modes are supported with the
--authorization-mode flag. Kubernetes The Hard Way uses Node,RBAC.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/#versioning  
Some notes about using kube-up and how that changes.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/#privilege-escalation-via-pod-creation  
Pretty insecure...

# 11:10
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/abac/  
Skipping this as I won't be using it.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#api-overview  
The RBAC API declares four top-level types.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#role-and-clusterrole  
Role
Contains rules which represent permissions. Makes sense. Roles must
provide a namespace.

ClusterRole
Same as a role, but is cluster-wide. Also encompasses resources which do
not have a namespace, like Nodes, /healthz, etc.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#rolebinding-and-clusterrolebinding  
RoleBinding
Grants permissions for a role to a user or set of users, referred to as
subjects (users, groups, service accounts). RoleBindings can reference
namespaces as well, this is useful for allowing a role to bind to a
ClusterRole without giving access to the whole cluster. It is redundant
when used with a regular Role, though (I think?)

ClusterRoleBinding
Grants access defined by a role to all namespaces in a cluster.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#referring-to-resources  
Example rules:
```
- apiGroups: [""]
resources: ["pods"]
verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["batch", "extensions"]
resources: ["jobs"]
verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
- apiGroups: [""]
resources: ["configmaps"]
resourceNames: ["my-config"]
verbs: ["get"]
```

Blecchhhhhhhhhh. I hate that we need this sort of thing in the world.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#referring-to-subjects  
Users are opaque strings. You can do whatever you want except that the
prefix `system:` is reserved for k8s.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#role-binding-examples  
Some example subjects for binding to a role:

```
- kind: User
name: "alice@example.com"
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
- kind: Group
name: "frontend-admins"
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
- kind: ServiceAccount
name: default
namespace: kube-system
```

The group a request belongs to is derived. So, all authed users are in
`system:authenticated`, for example, and non-authed users are in
`system:unauthenticated`.

```
- kind: Group
name: system:authenticated
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Just stopping a moment to laugh and say OF COURSE the one area of the site
I didn't completely read contains the information I need to fix the only
major problem I had setting up a cluster from scratch.

Also, I am so glad I am entering k8s now and not a year ago. I can see such
pain around trying to maintain backwards compatibility with all the various
ways access is conferred in a cluster. Also, it's super telling and cool to
see that k8s started without all of this. Shit doesn't have to be perfect
right out the gate, people.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#default-roles-and-role-bindings  
Some default roles and bindings are created to bootstrap the system into
running. Messing with them can break everything. One example is the
`system:node` ClusterRole. Kubelets might break if this is altered.

All the defaults roles and bindings are labeled with
`kubernetes.io/bootstrapping=rbac-defaults`

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#auto-reconciliation  
Restarting the API server re-installs the default cluster roles. This fixes
breakages and also allows the system to update itself when upgrading.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#discovery-roles  
system:basic-user
Access to see basic information about themselves. Assigned to all users.

system:discovery
Read only access to discovery endpoints to negotiate further access.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#user-facing-roles  
cluster-admin
Superuser access. Can do everything.

admin
Access to almost everything, scoped by a namespace. Cannot change quotas.

edit
Read/write to almost everything in a namespace except role bindings.

view
Read access to almost everything in a namespace except role bindings.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#core-component-roles  
system:kube-scheduler
Access to resources required by kube-scheduler.
Autobound at cluster level.

system:kube-controller-manager
Access to resources required by kube-controller-manager. Specific control
loops are controlled by other roles.
Autobound at cluster level.

system:node
Allows access to all resources required by the kubelet. That's read access
to all secrets and write access to all pod status objects!
No binding in 1.8+. Is this my problem getting a node authorized?
Not sure yet.

system:node-proxier
Access to resources required by kube-proxy.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#other-component-roles  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#controller-roles  
Lots more roles listed. Reading through but not recording anything here.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#privilege-escalation-prevention-and-bootstrapping  
Users who have permission to edit roles or role bindings can only update
or create new ones that are scoped to their existing permissions.

The initial user must break this contract by communicating with the API
insecurely or by using a credential that lands you in the `system:masters`
group.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#command-line-utilities  
Some examples showing how to use kubectl to do this. Review at this point.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#service-account-permissions  
Prior to 1.6 it was the wild west, seems like everything had access to
everything. With RBAC that's pretty locked down now.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#upgrading-from-15  
Glad I don't have to do this.

# 11:55
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/node/  
Node authorization is a special-purpose authorization mode that specifically
authorizes API requests made by kubelets.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/node/#overview  
Allows a kubelet to:
Read services, endpoints, nodes, pods, secrets, configmaps, pvc and pvs
related to pods running on the kubelet.

Write node and node status, pod and pod status.

NodeRestriction admission plugin limits kubelet to modify its own node and
pods bound to itself.

Read/write access to the certificationsigningrequests API for TLS
bootstrapping. The ability to create tokenreviews and subjectaccessreviews
for delegated authentication/authorization checks

# 12:00
I think I found my problem.
> In order to be authorized by the Node authorizer, kubelets must use a
credential that identifies them as being in the system:nodes group, with a
username of system:node:<nodeName>. This group and user name format match
the identity created for each kubelet as part of kubelet TLS bootstrapping.

...my kubelets are being recognized as system:anonymous. How to fix that?

More on this later. Going out with Tara.
