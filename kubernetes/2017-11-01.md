Picking up where I left off at:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#installation  
Spinning up a kube cluster using minikube worked flawlessly.

Using kubectl to run and expose containers worked too.

Spinning down a kube cluster using minikube worked flawelessly too.

Now the docs are showing me how to use the rkt container engine but I have
no idea why or what impact that actually has. I'm starting up a new
minikube cluster with that container runtime now.

Now the docs are saying I should re-use the docker daemon inside minikube.
They give me a bunch of information about how to tag my containers so they
don't break a pull image policy. Not sure what that is. There is also a
warning about how failure to follow these guidelines could result in an
"ErrImagePull" error... I don't know where that error would occur but maybe
it'll be useful later.

I just configured my environment to communicate with the docker daemon
running inside my minikube VM using `eval $(minikube docker-env)`.

printenv shows this added
DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376
DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/tkellen/.minikube/certs
DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.23

Makes sense to me.

The docs are reminding me to turn off the imagePullPolicy:Always, as
otherwise Kubernetes won't use images I built locally. Not sure how to
do that.

Googling `imagePullPolicy:Always`, I wind up at:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/  
This is a lot of additional documentation.

I am going to ignore this instruction for now and see what happens.

# 11:45
https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#managing-your-cluster  
Okay, so I'm getting a bit more detail about how minikube works. Neat.

Looks like you can use minikube to install any version of k8s. Yay, I
am sure a lot of fun awaits me trying to keep my scheduler up to date :p.

It seems minikube has some sugar for configuring kubernetes. I wonder
what it's doing under the hood. I'm not going to look yet.

There are a bunch of examples of settings I could change. I don't know
what any of them mean.

It seems one of the things minikube does to help me is create new
"kubectl context". Not sure what that is. Jumping to the docs that
are linked.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/v1.8/#-em-set-context-em-  
The most useful thing I learned from that page is that something called a
"kubeconfig" exists. I assume that's a configuration file. I am ignoring
this for now.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#interacting-with-your-cluster  
Neat, there is a dashboard.

Yay, I can access services. Not sure what that means.

# 12:00
Time for lunch.

# 12:15
Back to it.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/gettig-started-guides/minikube/#networking  

Learning about networking with minikube now.

Looks like `minikube ip` will tell me the host ip of the k8s cluster
running in the VM. Got it.

Looks like services I am running in the cluster can be accessed at that IP.
Cool. There is an example of how to look up a service:

`kubectl get service $SERVICE --output='jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}"'`

$SERVICE isn't assigned to anything. Let me check my dashboard to see if
I can find a service to request the port for.

Doesn't seem that way. Lots of errors on the dashboard about the flag
--no-store being deprecated and that I should use --pull-policy=update.
Maybe that has something to do with the image pull policy thing earlier?
Not sure. Ignoring this section for now.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#persistent-volumes  
Okay, so now I'm learning about how minikube supports persisting data in
the VM. I feel like I'm just getting a random selection of things that
minikube can do at this point. Will this be relevant in production? Where
does minikube begin and end?

https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#mounted-host-folders  
I'm running the VirtualBox hypervisor. Seems like this is telling me that
the kubernetes cluster running in the VM can access /Users on my host.
Good to know!

https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#private-container-registries  
Don't have one. Skipping this.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#using-minikube-with-an-http-proxy  
Glad I am not behind a HTTP proxy. Skipping this.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#design  
Okay, some new terminology. Minikube uses libmachine and localkube.
Are these relevant in production? Following this rabbit hole for a moment.

I'm linked to https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/libmachine  
...no README. Googling...
Too deep. Backing out.

Let's see about localkube.
https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/tree/master/pkg/localkube  
Same story. Too deep. Backing out.

Now reading about the minikube proposal.

https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/cluster-lifecycle/local-cluster-ux.md  
I wish this was the first thing I read!

# 12:35
Talking to @mattsurabian.

# 13:00
Philosophically minikube seems like a bad idea to me. I appreciate how
quickly it seems to get me a local cluster, but I don't like how much it
is abstracting over.

I have set up consul/nomad in the past and it was quite simple to do so.

I'll continue anyway.

Done with the minikube documentation. It's not entirely clear what the
next step is.

Back at the docs home screen, I see that I skipped the interactive tutorial.
Probably should have done that first. Doing so now.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/  
Makes sense to me. Definitely should have done this first.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/cluster-intro/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/cluster-interactive/  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-intro/  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-interactive/  
Everything was going well until module 2 step 3 where the terminology "Pods"
was introduced without explanation. Docs say I can start a proxy to a Pod
with kubectl but I don't really know what that is. Going to read about Pods
now.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/  
Ah. This is a grouping of containerized applications that run "together".
That's enough context for now.

Back to:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-interactive/  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/explore-intro/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/explore-interactive/  
Makes sense to me. This section explains pods as well.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose-intro/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose-interactive/  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/scale-intro/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/scale-interactive/  
Makes sense to me.

# 14:00
Taking a break.

# 14:30
Back to it.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update-intro/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update-interactive/  
Makes sense to me.
Saw the ErrImgPull issue I was confused about earlier while running an
upgrade on a deployment! The tutorial shows what happens if you try to
use a container image that does not exist (or cannot be found). While
spamming `kubectl get pods` as the rollout failed one of the pods went
into the status "ErrImgPull"

# 14:50
That was pretty great! I feel like I now have a decent understanding of the
basic concepts that Kubernetes exposes.

There are two online courses I may come back to, but will skip for now:
https://www.udacity.com/course/scalable-microservices-with-kubernetes--ud615  
https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-kubernetes-linuxfoundationx-lfs158x  

Moving on to hello minikube!
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/hello-minikube/  

Skimmed most of this--it's cementing what I learned in a slightly harder
fashion earlier. Feeling good that I understand everything on this page!

Got confirmation on my earlier assumption about kubectl contexts. Operators
may interact with multiple Kubernetes clusters. The settings, or "context"
for each are stored under `~/.kube/config`. When using `kubectl` you can
specify which to use for each command by specifying `--context`, or you can
persist which context you want to use directly into ~/.kube/config with
`kubectl config use-context <name>`.

Looks like the currently-active context is specified under the property
current-context. I tried to delete this so I could force myself to specify
the context with every `kubectl` command but it seems `kubectl` just selects
the first context in the absence of a specified one.

I may investigate later how to enforce opting in to a context but for now
I am moving on.

# 15:10
I am now removing kubectl, minikube, docker for mac and completely starting
over. Also taking a detour to see if I can get docker running on OSX
natively using xhyve.

Found this:
https://gist.github.com/0x414A/0d5303b787a449cd564f  

Worked flawlessly. I now have a docker-machine running on xyvhe.

‚ùØ docker-machine ls
NAME   ACTIVE   DRIVER   STATE     URL                       SWARM   DOCKER        ERRORS
dev    *        xhyve    Running   tcp://192.168.64.2:2376           v17.10.0-ce

# 15:40
Talkin' to friends.

# 16:05
Now trying to get a local k8s cluster running using these instructions:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/hello-minikube/  

This failed.

Confused a bit about how docker-machine interacts with minikube. Lost
in a sea of docker config right now. I should probably read all the
official Docker documentation as well.

# 16:30
Client work + talkin' to friends. Will return to this tomorrow.

# 22:30
Just back from dinner with neighbors.
Digging in a bit more.

I read this a year or two ago:
https://www.dockerbook.com  

It has been substantially updated since then. Neat.

Let's see...

# 23:30
Chapters 1 and 2 were a good refresher.
Chapters 3-7 I more or less skipped, I know this stuff.
I'll read Chapter 8 tomorrow morning.
Reverted back to running Docker CE.
Time for bed.
