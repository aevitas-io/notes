For the purposes of this story, I am a designer, developer and systems
administrator with fifteen years of experience engineering and maintaining
web services using a wide variety of programming languages, database systems
and hosting solutions.

On October 20th, 2017 I retired from full time employment, leaving a high
stress tech job to focus on the subject of this document. I still do some
consulting on the side.

I am embarking on an adventure to build a system to help prolific creators
organize and wield their output on life-long time scales.

In less grandiose terms: I am intentionally over-engineering a blogging and
e-commerce platform as an excuse to learn some stuff while supporting my
partner Tara and a few friends as they pursue their creative callings
online.

I have built and am responsible for the maintenance of numerous successful
monolithic applications. I plan to use a "microservice" architecture for
this project.

I have chosen this path for two reasons:

1. To satisfy an intellectual curiosity about building and maintaining a
distributed computing system.

2. To facilitate trying many different programming languages and development
paradigms in the service of a single project.

I am not sure where this will go but I'm eager to find out.

Everything I create will be placed in the public domain via a CC0 license:

From here on, this log will focus on the technical aspects of the project.
