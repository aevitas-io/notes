Home stretch. A few more docs to read and I'll be setting up my first
cluster!

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/limit-storage-consumption/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/limit-storage-consumption/#scenario-limiting-storage-consumption  
This describes how to limit the number of volume claims, the storage used
per claim, and the overall storage used by an entire namespace.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/limit-storage-consumption/#limitrange-to-limit-requests-for-storage  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/limit-storage-consumption/#storagequota-to-limit-pvc-count-and-cumulative-storage-capacity  
Use the LimitRange resource. Check.

# 11:45
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/#why-change-the-default-storage-class  
Depending on how you install your cluster, a StorgeClass might be defined
that could dynamically set values on PersistentVolumeClaims that are not
needed.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/#changing-the-default-storageclass  
`kubectl get storageclass` to see the setting.

This example goes on to show how to change this manually using an inline
kubectl patch. I am not running this.

Some further details back in the concepts section...
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#introduction  
StorageClass is primarily used to move some settings out of PVC resources so
users don't have to think about them.

# 11:50
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#cloud-controller-manager  
This is the new controller system that allows cloud-specific functionality
to be developed separately from k8s.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#administration  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#requirements  
To run the cloud controller manager you may need:
Tokens/iam creds, etc
RBAC rules to let the cloud controller manager speak to the apiserver
HA setup

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#running-cloud-controller-manager  
Omit `--cloud-provider` when starting `kube-controller-manager` to prevent
any built-in cloud loops that haven't been externalized, out.

Use `--cloud-provider=external` with the kubelet.

`kube-apiserver` should not run PersistentVolumeLabel admission controller.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#examples  
Shows config for a DaemonSet.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#limitations  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#support-for-volumes  
Volume support is still evolving. See
https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/178 for more.  

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#scalability  
Previously the kubelet provided node information. Now this comes from the
cloud controller manager--consider api rate limits for very large clusters.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#chicken-and-egg  
Boostrapping is still evolving...

# 12:00
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/developing-cloud-controller-manager/  
This is some light information about how to write your own cloud controller.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-multiple-schedulers/  
Neat. You can create your own scheduler and register it with the system and
you can also control which scheduler is used in a pod with the
`schedulerName` property.

Client work.

# 14:00
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/ip-masq-agent/#ip-masquerade-agent-user-guide  
Explains how to set up a DaemonSet for ip masquerading and what Node label
the sample config expects.

For some environments (Google Cloud is one), egress must come from a known
IP.  This agent makes network traffic from Pods destined for addresses
outside the cluster masquerade as traffic from the Node the Pod resides on.

By default, the agent is configured to treat the following CIDRs as
non-masquerade:
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16
169.254.0.0/16

The agent is configured to reload its configuration from the location
/etc/config/ip-masq-agent every 60 seconds.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#before-you-begin  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#configure-stub-domain-and-upstream-dns-servers  
Check.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#understanding-name-resolution-in-kubernetes  
K8s supports two Pod DNS policies. Default and ClusterFirst.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#default-dns-policy  
Default is not the default. ClusterFirst is. Default means inherit DNS from
he Node the Pod resides on. Odd naming choice!

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#clusterfirst-dns-policy  
By default, any names that don't match the cluster suffix are forwarded to
the upstream nameserver.

With custom config, the following occurs:
1. Hit kube-dns query cache.
2. From the cache layer, requests are routed thusly:
1. Name with cluster suffix (.cluster.local) is sent to kube dns.
2. Names with a stub domain (e.g. acme.local) are sent to the configured
IP
3. Names without a matching suffix are sent to upstream DNS.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#configmap-options  
Shows settings for the config `kube-dns` under the `kube-system` namespace.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#additional-examples  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#example-stub-domain  
Example shows how to integrate Consul:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
name: kube-dns
namespace: kube-system
data:
stubDomains: |
{“consul.local”: [“10.150.0.1”]}
```
Neato.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#example-upstream-nameserver  
Example shows how to send all upstream DNS requests to something other than
the Node:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
name: kube-dns
namespace: kube-system
data:
upstreamNameservers: |
[“172.16.0.1”]
```

# 15:05
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/static-pod/  
Static Pods are pods that the Kubelet maintains on its own without comms
back to the apiserver. It will watch a directory specified by:
`--pod-manifest-path`

Kubelet can also download pods by URL on a periodic basis, specified by
`--manifest-url`.

Pods started in this way will be seen by the API but you cannot delete them
using kubectl.

This weekend, I read about bootkube, a tool that lets you run Kubernetes in
Kubernetes. That is what I am going to use for my first cluster, which I
think I will run on AWS.

Time to do some research on where/how I want to host my cluster.

https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kube-aws  

So, for Amazon

With 7 t2.mediums.
3x for ectd
2x for a ha control plane
2x for nodes

$33x7 (on demand) = 231/mo
$21x7 (pay ahead) = 147/mo

I'm curious what Google charges. Checking now...
Seems you can have a 0-5 node cluster and you get k8s for free and you only
pay for the worker nodes. If I had 2x nodes here, I'd probably go with
n1-standard-2 (2 cpu, 8gb ram)

$48.55x2 worker VMs = $48.55
