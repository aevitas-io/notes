And we're back!

Going to skip testing the PodPresets thing. I understand it enough.

I am quite turned around about what I have completed in the tasks section
and what I have not. It's super annoying that some menu items jump to other
areas of the tasks. I suppose I should pay closer attention.

In a separate document I will not record, I am listing every main link in
the tasks section so I can go through it and mark which are done. Then, I
will be more judicious in the order of my traversal for these docs.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#before-you-begin  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#create-a-namespace  
Check.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#specify-a-memory-request-and-a-memory-limit  
You can specify resource limits and requests in your pod spec.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#exceed-a-containers-memory-limit  
Installed the heapster plugin, deployed a pod that allocates some ram, used
kubectl proxy and queried for metrics to see how much was being used. Makes
sense.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#specify-a-memory-request-that-is-too-big-for-your-nodes  
Pod scheduling is based on the total of all requests inside its containers
compared to the Node it might be scheduled on. If the sum of a Pod's
request's exceeds what the Node has available, it won't be scheduled.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#memory-units  
Lots of different ways to specify your memory limit: E, P, T, G, M, K, Ei,
Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki. Check.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#if-you-dont-specify-a-memory-limit  
No limit on the pod means container can consume everything the Node has
available, or will be bounded by the limits of the namespace it is in.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#motivation-for-memory-requests-and-limits  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#clean-up  
Make sense to me.

# 14:05
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#before-you-begin  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#create-a-namespace  
Check.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#specify-a-cpu-request-and-a-cpu-limit  
This is the same exercise as a the last except for CPU instead of RAM.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#cpu-units  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#specify-a-cpu-request-that-is-too-big-for-your-nodes  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#if-you-dont-specify-a-cpu-limit  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#motivation-for-cpu-requests-and-limits  
Same as last section.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#before-you-begin  
Check.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#qos-classes  
Pods have QoS classes:
- Guaranteed
- Burstable
- BestEffort

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-namespace  
Check.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-pod-that-gets-assigned-a-qos-class-of-guaranteed  
To get a QoS of Guaranteed each container in pod must have and use the same
limit and request values for both cpu and ram.

If you define a limit but not a request, k8s automatically makes the request
value match.

You can see the QoS class in the description of the pod under `qosClass`

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-pod-that-gets-assigned-a-qos-class-of-burstable  
A Pod is burstable if it doesn't meet the requirements for Guaranteed and at
least one container has a cpu or memory request.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-pod-that-gets-assigned-a-qos-class-of-besteffort  
Best effort is assigned to a Pod whose containers make no requests.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-pod-that-has-two-containers  
Shows an example of a "Burstable" configuration.

So, okay, there is a `qosClass` assigned to ever Pod... what does it do? Is
this just information for operators? Note to self: dig into what qosClass
does under the hood.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-volume-storage/#whats-next  
This is review. All makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persisent-volume-storage/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/#before-you-begin

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/#create-a-persistentvolume  
Dropped a file in /tmp/data and made a "hostPath" persistent volume that
references it.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/#create-a-persistentvolumeclaim  
Creating a claim makes k8s look for a volume that matches the requirements.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/#create-a-pod  
Create a pod that claims the volume and uses it.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/#access-control  
You can annotate a persistent volume with a specific GID that will be
applied to any usages of it.

# 14:20

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-projected-volume-storage/#configure-a-projected-volume-for-a-pod  
This is review. It's possible to mount a volume in multiple locations.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/  
Pods and Containers have a security context.
Settings include:
Discretionary Access Control, e.g. perms to access files by gid/uid.
SELinux - objects are assigned security labels. bleh
Running as privileged or unprivileged - running as root or not
Linux capabilities - give a proc some root privs but not all
AppArmor - program profiles for restricting capabilities of programs
Seccomp - limit process to open file descriptors
AllowPrivilegeEscalation - can process elevate perms?

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#before-you-begin  
Check.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod  
This is controlled in both the pod and container spec by `securityContext`
property.

Demo showing that the fsGroup property is respected and the runAsUser is as
well. ps aux shows processes running as UID matching runUser. Mounted files
have fsGroup ID. Files created during interactive shell have the runAsUser
ID.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-container  
Container securityContext values override Pod level configurations.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-capabilities-for-a-container  
Confirmed it is possible to control capability settings.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#assign-selinux-labels-to-a-container  
SELinux options can be controlled with the property `seLinuxOptions` and
requires that the host Node have SELinux available.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#discussion  
Only volumes that support ownership management respect `fsGroup`.

# 14:35
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/  
This doc is missing heading level anchors.


Accessing the api server using kubectl connects you as the user "admin",
typically.

Use the Default Service Account to access the API server.
The token that ends up in every container connects as the user "default".

The ServiceAccount a Pod uses is defined under `spec.serviceAccountName`.

It's possible to create new ServiceAccounts and to prevent them from auto
mounting the token associated by setting `automountServiceAccountToken` to
false. At the Pod level you can also prevent auto mounting the token here
with `automountServiceAccountToken`.

Use Multiple Service Accounts.
Every namespace gets its own "default" Service Account.
Cannot create pods with ServiecAccounts referenced that do not yet exist.
ServiceAccounts of existing Pods cannot be changed.

Manually create a service account API token.
It's possible to manually control the service account token value. Not
sure why you'd want to do that.

Add ImagePullSecrets to a service account
imagePullSecrets have a special handler and setting.
