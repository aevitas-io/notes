https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#summary  
K8s assumes all Pod can communicate regardless of which Node they are on.
Each Pod has its own IP. No container/host port mapping needed. Pods make
it possible to treat a group of containers like a VM with respect to port
allocation, configuration, etc.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#docker-model  
Docker uses host-private networking. Bridge, called docker0 is created.
For each container, docker allocates veth and connects it to the bridge.
veth is mapped to eth0 in the container. The in-container network gets an
ip in the range of the bridge. Containers in this model can only talk if
the are attached to the same bridge (machine).

Communicating across node is done via careful port forwarding.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#kubernetes-model  
Port coordination is hard with large teams. Also, developers shouldn't have
to think about cluster level concerns. Dynamic port allocation is complex.
Every app has to use port flags, api servers have to insert dynamic ports
into config blocks, Services have to find each-other, etc etc. K8s sidesteps
this and mandates that:

All containers can communicate with all other containers without NAT.
All nodes can communicate with all containers without NAT.
The IP a container sees itself as is the same as what others see.

This makes it easy to port apps that used to run on VMs with their own IP
and expect to communicate with other VMs etc.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#how-to-achieve-this  
So, you can't just have two computers running docker, slap k8s on it and
call it a day...

Use taints and tolerations to control what is scheduled on nodes with custom
sysctls.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/sysctl-cluster/#safe-vs-unsafe-sysctls  
There is a very small subset of sysctls that can be used in an isolated way
from Pod to Pod.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/sysctl-cluster/#enabling-unsafe-sysctls  
There is an escape hatch to using any sysctls for performance tuning.

Sysctls can be controlled via Pod specification but is in beta.

# 03:45
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/  
Logs have a different lifecycle independent of Nodes, Pods or containers.
K8s doesn't provide a built-in solution for managing this back end.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#basic-logging-in-kubernetes  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#logging-at-the-node-level  
Kubelet keeps one terminated container around for inspection.
Consider using logrotate at the Node level.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#system-component-logs  
The scheduler itself and kube-proxy run in containers.
Kubelet and container runtime log to systemd on Node.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#cluster-level-logging-architectures  
Logging approaches:
- One logging agent per node
- Dedicated "sidecar" container for logging
- Pushing logs directly to aggregator from application

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#using-a-node-logging-agent  
Logging agent per node is commonly a DaemonSet. This is the encouraged
approach. It's limited to capturing stderr/stdout, though.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#using-a-sidecar-container-with-the-logging-agent  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#streaming-sidecar-container  
Neaaaaat.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#sidecar-container-with-a-logging-agent  
Putting a logging agent in place with every application can be done. It may
consume a lot of resources or make it harder to see logs with `kubectl logs`
though.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#exposing-logs-directly-from-the-application  
Pushing from every application is possible, sure.

# 04:10
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/kubelet-garbage-collection/  
This is a feature that removes unused containers and images.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/kubelet-garbage-collection/#image-collection  
K8s manages all images through "imageManager"

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/kubelet-garbage-collection/#container-collection  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/kubelet-garbage-collection/#user-configuration  
Some flags for kubelet to further control this:

image-gc-high-threshold
percentage of disk usage when gc is run.

image-gc-low-threshold
percentage of free space kubelet tries to maintain, default 80%.

minimum-container-ttl-duration
minimum age before GC-ing a container is even considered.

maximum-dead-containers-per-container
max number of dead containers a given pod is allowed.

maximum-dead-containers
max number of dead containers period at the node level.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/kubelet-garbage-collection/#deprecation  
The notes I just took about kubelet flags may be obviated by new options.

# 04:20
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/federation/#why-federation  
Run multiple clusters across multiple clouds. Primarily supported by making
it possible to sync config between clouds and enable cross-cluster discovery
via automatically configured DNS.

Could also support super paranoid HA and the avoidance of cloud provider
lock in.

Having clusters globally located can lower latency. Fault isolation may be
possible... one cluster fails and another still runs. Scalability for very
large clusters can be an issue that running multiple clusters helps.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/federation/#caveats  
Increased network/bandwidth cost... a control plane is monitoring all of the
clusters to ensure the state is correct. This can generate a lot of traffic.

The federation control plane can break all clusters.

Federation project is relatively new.

Okay, got it working by adding a hostPath Persistent Volume so there is
something for the deployment to actually claim.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-single-instance-stateful-application/#accessing-the-mysql-instance  
Check.
Note to self, using clusterIP: None on services that don't have replicas is
a good idea because DNS will just resolve right to the pod.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-single-instance-stateful-application/#updating  
When dealing with state, don't scale without StatefulSet or things will go
awry with persistence. If the volume can be mounted by more than one Pod I
would assume we'd have two mysql instances running trying to use the same
data files.

Use the strategy "recreate" instead of "rolling" or the same issues above
could happen when running an update.

Autoscaling during rolling update
HPA only binds to a deployment object. You can't use the underlying
replication controller.
