# 18:00
Had a rubber ducking session w/ @mattsurabian around 15:00. Here is the
general outcome.

First. Why am I not running Linux as my dev machine yet? I know, I know.

WTF is docker-machine? How does it interact with xhyve? Why does minikube
start a VM in VirtualBox if I have xhyve? What is Docker CE actually *doing*
to my machine? Assuming I get all this crap running, how does minikube
interact with it?

Okay, time to state the "obvious" to dig myself out of this hole.

What do I know?

Containerization, as orchestrated by the docker daemon, needs linux kernel
features. Thus, the docker daemon cannot run on OSX natively.

The docker cli is a rest api client to the docker daemon. It can run
natively on any OS.

To run docker containers on OSX, I need a linux VM running the docker
daemon.

I also need the docker cli configured to communicate with the
daemon in that VM.

To run a VM on OSX, I need a hypervisor. I usually use VirtualBox. I'd like
to use xhyve because it's "native" to OSX. I have no idea what real benefits
this confers. Note to self: read more about xhyve.

Docker-machine spins up a linux VM (at least on OSX) running the docker
daemon using whatever hypervisor I specify.

If I install xhyve, docker, docker-machine and docker-machine-driver-xhyve,
I should be able to get a linux VM running the docker daemon and control it.

❯ docker-machine create --driver xhyve default

It worked!

❯ docker-machine ls

default   -        xhyve    Running   tcp://192.168.64.4:2376           v17.10.0-ce

Okay, I have a docker daemon running on OSX. Now I need to tell the docker
cli how to communicate with it. docker-machine provides a command to make
this easy:

❯ docker-machine env default
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.64.4:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/tkellen/.docker/machine/machines/default"
export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="default"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval $(docker-machine env default)

❯ eval $(docker-machine env default)

Okay. My local docker cli is now set up to talk to the daemon in my
linux VM. Let's see if I can spin up a container running alpine linux.

❯ docker run -it --rm alpine
Unable to find image 'alpine:latest' locally

bin    dev    etc    home   lib    media  mnt    proc   root   run    sbin   srv    sys    tmp    usr    var
/ # exit

Yup.

Okay, docker is up and I feel like I understand enough of what is happening
to continue.

Now. Minikube. Does that start... as containers inside the linux VM I
already have?

❯ minikube start --vm-driver=xhyve

It says starting VM. It also has me specify a vm-driver. So, no. This is
another VM. Hmm, xhyve doesn't seem to have any interface to see what VMs
are running.

❯ ps aux | grep xhyve

Confirmed. I have two VMs running.

So... two different docker daemons. Let's see.

❯ docker-machine env
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.64.4:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/tkellen/.docker/machine/machines/default"
export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="default"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval $(docker-machine env)

❯ minikube docker-env
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.64.6:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/tkellen/.minikube/certs"
export DOCKER_API_VERSION="1.23"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval $(minikube docker-env)

Yup. So, if I always intend to use minikube, I don't need docker-machine.

Neat.

I bet I will want to go back to the docker app eventually. I'm sure things
are going to get jacked up when I start using volumes.
So. much. indirection.

Back to docs.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/hello-minikube/  
Everything on this page now makes sense to me at what feels like a
reasonable level of depth.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/hello-minikube/#whats-next  
I am not using the links in this section. All of them leave the tutorial
area of the site. Thus far the tutorial area is WAY BETTER than the rest.

# 18:00
I still don't like how much stuff minikube is doing under the hood. How does
that relate to production? Maybe I shouldn't care about this at all. Maybe
nobody runs their whole cluster locally. If a microservice is actually
isolated you shouldn't need the whole cluster anyway...

Carrying on.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/#kubectl-cli-and-pods  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/#kubectl-cli  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/#pods  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/#pod-definition  
Makes sense to me.

Jumping out to read this:
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/README.md  
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/architecture.md  
Makes sense to me. Impressive!

Also read this (linked in the doc):

# 18:30
Break to talk with Tara.

# 19:50
https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/k8s201/  
Detour to fix an error in the docs I've seen on a bunch of pages. The
tutorial indicates a specific version of kubernetes is needed but the
version value is missing.

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[Minikube](/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube),
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/playground)
* [Play with Kubernetes](http://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)

{% if page.min-kubernetes-server-version == page.version %}
Your Kubernetes server must be version {{page.min-kubernetes-server-version}}.
{% else %}
Your Kubernetes server must be version {{page.min-kubernetes-server-version}} or later.
{% endif %} To check the version, enter `kubectl version`.

~/website master
❯ grep -R min-kubernetes-server-version *
_includes/task-tutorial-prereqs.md:{% if page.min-kubernetes-server-version == page.version %}
_includes/task-tutorial-prereqs.md:Your Kubernetes server must be version {{page.min-kubernetes-server-version}}.
_includes/task-tutorial-prereqs.md:Your Kubernetes server must be version {{page.min-kubernetes-server-version}} or later.
docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment.md:min-kubernetes-server-version: v1.8
```

Hmm. Going to post an issue, it's not clear where this value should be
defined and I'd like to keep moving forward.

https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/6165  

# 20:15
https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/k8s201/#labels  
Made a config for a pod with a label, spun it up, then deleted it.
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/k8s201/#deployments  
Deployments can define templates for pods and scale multiples up or down.
The docs seem to indicate a deployment selects the pods it controls by
using a label selector... does that mean you can spin up pods directly and
then control them after the fact with a deployment?

Could a pod be controlled by two deployments?
That seems wrong. Let me experiment.
Let me get a deployment going and test.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/k8s201/#deployment-management  
Spun up a deployment with the same label as the pod I spun up earlier.

Trying to figure out how to see the labels for a pod...

Found it.

❯ kubectl get pods --show-labels
```
NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       LABELS
nginx                               1/1       Running   0          8m        app=nginx
nginx-deployment-569477d6d8-4hdsw   1/1       Running   0          9m        app=nginx,pod-template-hash=1250338284
nginx-deployment-569477d6d8-plth2   1/1       Running   0          9m        app=nginx,pod-template-hash=1250338284
```

Looks like there is some special label added by the deployment.
I assume the deployment controls pods it exactly matches for based on that
hash. Enough for now. Moving on.

# 20:40
https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/k8s201/#services  
So, services let you give an IP to a selection of pods. Could the same pod
be represented by multiple services? We'll see.

Yup! I created two services that select the nginx pods. They both have
their own IP and they both route traffic to the pods.

Neat.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/k8s201/#health-checking  
This is so, so dope.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/k8s201/#process-health-checking  
Yup.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/k8s201/#application-health-checking  
Yup.

# 20:55
I still have a lot to learn about getting this thing into production but I
am sold. This is going to be incredible.

I worry about how hard it will be to get developers up and running with this
stack... will it be harder than Vagrant was? Probably.

That's enough for now. Time to hang with Tara.
