Okay, I think I have a basic grasp of Volumes at this point. Back at the
tutorials section I've noticed that the "Stateless Application" menu item
had kicked me into the "Tasks" section of the documentation. I'm going to
skip that for now (I'll read the entire tasks section later).

Back at the tutorials area, I'm going to read every link that stays in
this section.

More of this please.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/#scale-the-web-frontend  
Of course it is this easy.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/#cleaning-up  
Mind. Blown.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/expose-external-ip-address/#objectives  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/expose-external-ip-address/#before-you-begin  
Ready, except I am going to use minikube and not a cloud provider.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/expose-external-ip-address/#creating-a-service-for-an-application-running-in-five-pods  
The IPs exposed are on the minikube VM network. Confirmed from within the
VM with `minikube ssh` + curl calls.

# 00:25
Detour to read about kubernetes integration with hashicorp tools.
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/1957  
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/10439  

Seems fraught.

Also learned that k8s had no secrets encryption until 1.7.

# 01:00
Getting a bit tired. Going to tackle another tutorial section first tho.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/  
...looks like this uses a concept I'm not familiar with, StatefulSet.

Jumping out to learn about that:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/  
Okay, so these are somewhat the same as a Deployment but the pod names they
generate are not totally dynamic. I can see using this for a database setup
with master/slave where the master is pod "0" and the slaves are N number
of pods after. I wonder if the redis master/slave tutorial I used with
was written before StatefulSet existed?

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#using-statefulsets  
Makes sense.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#limitations  
Beta feature.
Requires a Headless Service. Not sure what that is. Will investigate later,
I am already like three jumps out from where I started.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#components  
Sure.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#pod-selector  
Sure.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#pod-identity  
Makes sense. I just realized I have no idea how DNS is managed for k8s. I
really need to read the concepts section soon. Ignoring this for now.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#deployment-and-scaling-guarantees  
Pods created/addded/deleted sequentially when deploying/scaling/deleting.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#pod-management-policies  
Unsurprisingly you can relax the ordering restrictions a bit.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#update-strategies  
Not retaining this.... time for bed

# 12:00
Back. Some light reading while I eat lunch... going to cruise through some
of the concepts section.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#master-components  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-apiserver  
Can't imagine when I'll ever have enough load to scale this thing...

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#etcd  
The github issues I read last night about integrating k8s with hashicorp
tools like consul make it seems like etcd was an implementation detail
of k8s. This is making me think I have to install it separately and manage
it myself. I guess I'll find out for sure when I start running my first
cluster.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-controller-manager  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kube-controller-manager/  
Cool.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#cloud-controller-manager  
Interesting to see their mention of breaking this out so this part of the
system can evolve independently, and so the cloud providers themselves can
own the integrations. I had this same struggle working on Grunt and gulp.
I've seen Hashicorp thrashing on it with it on Terraform. I've watched
ESlint, Babel and countless other tools evolve this way. It would be
interesting to write about this "standard" arc for building tools that
integrate over multiple ecosystems. That might help other tool builders
contextualize where they are in their own evolution.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#addons  
Neat.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#dns  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#web-ui-dashboard  
Looking forward to digging into this more. I've only seen it for a few
seconds during my first hours messing with minikube.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#container-resource-monitoring  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#cluster-level-logging  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#node-components  
Check.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kubelet  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-proxy  
This controls iptables inside the node.

I wonder how this plays with envoy...

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/istio-users/BgV0_wnL74Q  
Seems like Envoy configures iptables inside the pod, which bypasses
the node. Not sure on this.  Moving on...

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#docker  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#rkt  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#supervisord  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#fluentd  
Check.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#understanding-kubernetes-objects  
K8s objects describe a desired state. K8s is always working to get the
cluster to reflect that state.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#object-spec-and-status  
Two primary nested objects, the spec and the status. Operators control the
spec, k8s controls the status.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#describing-a-kubernetes-object  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#required-fields  
I know this stuff now. Nice review.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/  
Check.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/  
My only usage for these will probably be dev/staging/production.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#motivation  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors  
Note: the label selectors of two controllers must not overlap within a namespace, otherwise they will fight with each other.

I think this speaks to what I was wondering earlier about multiple
deployments being in control of the same resources. Seems like it might be
possible? I'll look more later.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#equality-based-requirement  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#set-based-requirement  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#api  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#list-and-watch-filtering  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#set-references-in-api-objects  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#selecting-sets-of-nodes  
Makes sense. How many human hours have been spent defining and documenting
API semantics like this? It's sort of tiring to me that we don't have a
universal standard for it. I wonder how well jsonapi (jsonapi.org) would
handle the use-cases here, or graphql...

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/  
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/#attaching-metadata-to-objects  
Makes sense to me.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/
Makes sense. Gives me a headache. Versioning APIs is such a PITA.

# 12:50
Done for now. Off to work on the radiant heating system in the workshop.

Going to continue my detour in finishing the concepts section before I
return to the tutorials.
